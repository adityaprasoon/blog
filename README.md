# My simple blog

> Why blog in a github repo?
> After having tried (and getting frustrated) with many static site generators I have finally settled with one of the simplest way to put my writings online. Why? Because I want to focus on actually putting my thoughts out there instead of being bogged down with learning, maintaining and troubleshooting some off the shelf solution. I could never find something that did exactly what I wanted and almost always I had to dig in the documentations to customise it. And almost always what was supposed to be a writing avenue became a waste of time for 2-3 days.
> So now no config, no styling tweaking, no custom domain, just a collection of markdown files in a github repo.
