# My simple blog

> **Why blog in a GitHub repo?**
> After trying (and getting frustrated with) many static site generators, I’ve finally settled on one of the simplest ways to put my writings online. Why? Because I want to focus on sharing my thoughts rather than > being bogged down by learning, maintaining, and troubleshooting an off-the-shelf solution. I could never find something that did exactly what I wanted. Almost always, I had to dig through documentation to customize > it. And more often than not, what was supposed to be a writing outlet turned into a waste of 2–3 days.
>
> So now, no configuration, no style tweaking, no custom domain—just a collection of markdown files in a GitHub repo.
